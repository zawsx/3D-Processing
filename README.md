# Generative Art

> “If you make art no one else can, you have no competition.”

This repository contains code sketches and ideas-in-progress as I learn the [Processing language](http://processing.org/) and [Hype framework](http://www.hypeframework.org/). My learning and research has been primarily influenced by Joshua Davis’ helpful [Programming Graphics I: Introduction to Generative Art course](http://skl.sh/1eqDLra).

This repository aims to not contain files that have difficult licensing schemes, such as the fonts I have used or art I do not have license to share.

This repository will improve both in depth and breadth with time, with an ongoing focus to better-document my thoughts and processes. There are many in-line comments in place currently and I will endeavor to treat these ideas more like code classes through an explanation at the header of their purpose, their output, and interesting places to modify code for output.

## Ongoing updates

I will also be recording my thoughts on the process and my learning, at [https://medium.com/generatived-art](https://medium.com/generatived-art).

To see work made by others in the Processing environment, visit [OpenProcessing](http://www.openprocessing.org/).

## License

You’re free to do as you please with the files contained in this repo, including commercial use of whatever you may generate. If you do use these files, especially in a way that results in anything you find cool, absolutely let me know so that I can cheer on your great work.

Your pal,
